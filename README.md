# Advanced Lane Finding Project

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

---

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

I used [this jupyter notebook](https://github.com/HidetoKimura/carnd_advanced_lane_lines/blob/master/project_main.ipynb) in this project. Because in this project to do data analysis and visualization is very important.
Here is the file structures.

### File Structures

project_main.ipynb - The jupyter notebook of the project.    
camera_dist_pickle.p - The pickle file of the camera dist/mtx.  
processed_project_video.mp4 - The result video.  
README.md - This file containing details of the project.  
/files/ - Folder for README.md.  
/output_images/couners_found/ - Folder for camera calibration.  
/output_images/undistorted/ - Folder for undistorted images.  
/output_images/lane_lines/ - Folder for masked lane lines.  


#### Camera Calibration

####1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the 2nd code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./project_main.ipynb " 

I start by preparing "objp", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world, and which will be the mesh grid like (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0) ....,(8,5,0). The "nx, ny" value isã€€equal to the number of chessboard corners.

If 'cv2.findChessboardCorners' is successful, it can get "corners", which are 2d arrays of coordnates of the chessboard corners, and append to "objpoints" and "imagepoint". You can check these correctness by using "cv2.drawChessboardCorners".

~~~~
nx = 9
ny = 6

# prepare object points, like (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (2,0,0) ....,(8,5,0)
objp = np.zeros((ny*nx,3), np.float32)
objp[:,:2] = np.mgrid[0:nx, 0:ny].T.reshape(-1,2)

objpoints = [] # 3d points in real world space
imgpoints = [] # 2d points in image plane.
:
# get grayscale image
:
# Find the chessboard corners
ret, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(gray, (nx, ny), None)

# If found, add object points, image points
if ret == True:        
        objpoints.append(objp)
        imgpoints.append(corners)

        cv2.drawChessboardCorners(img, (nx ,ny), corners, ret)
~~~~

You can use the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: 

~~~~
# Do camera calibration given object points and image points
ret, mtx, dist, rvecs, tvecs = cv2.calibrateCamera(objpoints, imgpoints, img_size,None,None)

# Save the camera calibration result for later use (we won't worry about rvecs / tvecs)
dist_pickle = {}
dist_pickle["mtx"] = mtx
dist_pickle["dist"] = dist
pickle.dump( dist_pickle, open( "camera_dist_pickle.p", "wb" ) )
:
undist_image = cv2.undistort(img, mtx, dist, None, mtx)

###Pipeline (single images)

####1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.
The folowing is the result of applying the undistortion transformation to a test image.
- Original Image
![alt text][test1_org]
- Undistortion Image
![alt text][test1_undist]

####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.
I used a combination of color and gradient thresholds to generate a binary image (thresholding steps at lines # through # in `another_file.py`).  Here's an example of my output for this step.  (note: this is not actually from one of the test images)

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])

```
This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

####4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text][image5]

####5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

I did this in lines # through # in my code in `my_other_file.py`

####6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

I implemented this step in lines # through # in my code in `yet_another_file.py` in the function `map_lane()`.  Here is an example of my result on a test image:

###Pipeline (video)

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)

---

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
